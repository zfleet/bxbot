## What is BX-bot?
BX-bot (_Bex_) is a simple [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) trading bot written in Java for trading on cryptocurrency [exchanges](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/).

The project contains the basic infrastructure to trade on a [cryptocurrency](http://coinmarketcap.com/) exchange...
except for the trading strategies - you'll need to write those yourself. A simple example [scalping strategy](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/02/081902.asp) is included to get you started with the Trading API - take a look [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/101014/basics-algorithmic-trading-concepts-and-examples.asp) for more ideas.

Exchange Adapters for using [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net), 
[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com), [OKCoin](https://www.okcoin.com/), [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/), 
[GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/), [itBit](https://www.itbit.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com), and [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) are included. Feel free to improve these or contribute new adapters to the project, that would be shiny.

The Trading API provides support for [limit orders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp)
traded at the [spot price](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp);
it does not support [futures](http://www.investopedia.com/university/beginners-guide-to-trading-futures/) or 
[margin](http://www.investopedia.com/university/margin/) trading.
